== Coding Standards for SuiteCRM

Some parts of the SuiteCRM code structure for PHP markup are
inconsistent in their style. SuiteCRM are working to gradually improve
this by helping our internal team and contributors maintain a consistent
style so the code can become clean and easy to read at a glance. This
will be an ongoing transition but we encourage users to begin to think
about their supplied bug fixes and enhancements to conform to the below
standards. We thank you for your continued contributions!

== License

At the beginning of each new *core* file include the following license
as the standard header

Ensure that the if statement for the valid entry point has been moved to
*below* the license.

[source, php]
if (!defined('sugarEntry') || !sugarEntry) {
    die('Not A Valid Entry Point');
}



== Indentation

Using PSR-2 Indentation.

Code MUST use an indent of *4 spaces*, and MUST NOT use tabs for
indenting.

JavaScript files should be indented using *2 spaces*.

== Class Names

Class names should use 'StudlyCaps' e.g ClassName, DoSomething.. Classes
should be named relevant to their Entity.

.Example
[source, php]
----
class YoungInfant extends Person 
{

} 
----

== Function Names

Function names should use lower camelCase e.g - functionName,
doSomething. Functions should also be named descriptively with
preferably a verb in them.

.Example
[source, php]
function printLoginStatus($user, $time) 
{
    // do Something
} 


In function arguments the variables should be descriptive of the
variables use.

== Variables

Static and Member variables should be lower camelCase and do not
abbreviate variable names un-necessarily.

.Example
[source, php]
----
public static $jobStrings;

var $disableRowLevelSecurity = true;  
----

Also ensure that uninitialised variables are checked if set by using the built-in `isset()`
function.

.Example
[source, php]
if (isset($forum)) 

== Quotations

Use single and double quotes when appropriate. If you’re not evaluating
anything in the string, use single quotes. There should be no need to
ever escape quotes within a string.

.Example
[source, php]
$sample = 'Hello'; 
$sample = "Hello, $name"; 
$sample = "Hello, \{$name}"; 

== Arrays

When declaring indexed arrays with the Array function, a trailing space
must be added after each comma delimiter to improve readability.

.Example
[source,php]
$sampleArray = array(1, 2, 3, 'Zend', 'Studio');  

When declaring a multi-line indexed array the
initial array item may begin on the following line. If so, it should be
padded at one indentation level greater than the line contain the array
declaration, and all successive lines should have the same indentation;
the closing parenthesis should be on a line by itself at the same
indentation level as the line contain the array declaration.

.Example
[source,php]
$sampleArray = array(
    1, 2, 3, 'Zend', 'Studio', 
    $a, $b, $c, 
    56.44, $d, 500, 
);  

When declaring associative arrays the initial array item may
begin on the following line. If so, it should be padded at one
indentation level greater than the line containing the array
declaration, and all successive lines should have the same indentation;
the closing parenthesis should be on a line by itself at the same
indentation level as the line containing the array declaration. For
readability, the various `=>` assignment operators should be padded such
that they align.

.Example
[source, php]
$sampleArray = array(
    'firstKey'  => 'firstValue', 
    'secondKey' => 'secondValue', 
); 

== Brace Style

*Always include the braces*: Even if not required still maintain the
braces to provide code clarity.

.Bad
[source, php]
----
if (condition) do_stuff();

if (condition)
    do_stuff(); 
----


.Good  
[source, php]
----
if (condition) 
{
    do_stuff(); 
}

if ($a != 2) {
    $a = 2; 
} 
elseif ($a == 3) {
    $a = 4; 
} 
else {
    $a = 7; 
} 
----

Opening bracket on class, function, method names should be on the next
line as the declaration and the exiting bracket on a line of its own.

.Example
[source, php]
----
class ThisClass 
{     
    public function newMethod()
    {

    } 
} 

function newFunction() 
{

} 
----

== Comments

Use https://phpdoc.org/[phpdoc] syntax before all
classes/methods/members/functions definitions. A simple template can be
set up in your IDE.

* All class definitions should have at least `@author` and `@package` with
the `@author` on the last line of the block-level comment
* Always start block-level comments containing phpdoc with two asterisks
(`/** ... */`)
* Single commenting should have a space first, followed by a capital
letter with no full stop needed `// This is an example`

Often comment on any tricky, obscure, or otherwise
not-immediately-obvious code to include any assumptions your code makes,
or preconditions for its proper operation. A developer should be able to
look at any part of the application and understand well enough what's
going on in a reasonable amount of time.

.Example
[source, php]
----
/**
* The method's summary
* 
* This method's short description which can span
* along multiple lines – also provide context
* to the method.
* 
* @param string $variable with a description of this argument
* @return void
*/

public function myMethod($variable) 
{
    // Do something here
} 
----

== General Guidelines

Any new class (including classed in generated files) should use the
constructor `__construct`, but only where a constructor is required.

.Example:
[source, php]
function __construct() 
{
    // do child class specific code here
    parent::__construct();
} 

{{% notice warning %}}
Ensure your code is compatible with current supported Operating Systems, Databases and PHP
versions and Browsers: see our link:/admin/compatibility-matrix[Compatibility Matrix].
{{% /notice %}}

== House Keeping

If including JavaScript files, a minified version should be used in the
core, with an un-minified version added to the equivalent directory
within `jssource` folder. Any modifications to JavaScript files should
be made in the `jssource` folder and then minified into the core.

If developing a new core feature do not create files within the custom
directory and ensure that the new module name is sensible and relevant
with no prefixes.

If adding a new module clean up generated files so only the required
files are used. The following are examples (but not limited to) of
tidying up a module's directory/files.

* Remove `studio.php` if it should not be in studio
* Remove `_sugar` class file from main class file if it not assignable
* or in security groups remove the option from the vardefs and remove

 // to ensure that modules created and deployed under CE will continue to function under team security if the instance is upgraded to PRO
